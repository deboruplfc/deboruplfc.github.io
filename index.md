## About Me

I am a CS Engineer with interest in distributed systems, data infrastructure, and data management. I completed my Master's in Computer Science at [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/), where I worked on data transfer optimization for network behavior forecasting. I hold a Bachelor's degree from the erstwhile [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology](https://nsut.ac.in/en/home), [University of Delhi](https://www.du.ac.in/).

I also have 3+ years of Software Engineering & Platform Engineering experience. Following graduation, I joined the Chief Data Office at [Nomura](https://www.nomura.com/) in New York where I built systems that handle ~10M trades daily with real-time processing. I was also involved in designing and maintaining Data & ML platforms with heterogeneous data connectors in both microservice & monolithic architectures. In the past, I spent two summers as a research intern at [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/) and a summer at [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri).

I've particularly enjoyed optimizing performance and refactoring legacy human-in-the-loop systems. I love to build things from the ground up - have previously been an early member of an [e-commerce startup](https://www.altdigital.tech/) which specializes in customer sales experience.

## Research Interests

My work explores distributed data systems that bridge theoretical foundations with practical scalability challenges in modern computing environments. I focus on developing intelligent storage architectures, self-optimizing databases, and adaptive data management systems that can dynamically respond to evolving workloads across diverse infrastructure. Building on my experience with large-scale data systems and AI/ML pipelines, I aim to advance next-generation distributed architectures that automatically adapt to changing computational demands.
